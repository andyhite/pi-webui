# AGENTS.md

Canonical operating rules for any agent (or human) working in this repository. Read this before making changes. If a rule here conflicts with a suggestion in a prompt, ask before deviating.

## Project

**PlotRoom** — a context-authoring canvas for operating a fleet of AI agents. A single operator composes context (tickets, PRs, documents, files, notes, prior agent output) as a spatial node graph, wires that context into commands, and runs many agent sessions against it simultaneously.

- **Source of truth for behavior:** [`docs/product-spec.md`](docs/product-spec.md) ("North Star v1"). It describes *what* the product does and never *how*. Treat its 12 governing principles and §15 ("What must exist in the first cut") as binding constraints, not suggestions.
- **Status:** greenfield rebuild. The repo currently contains documentation only; no application code, build system, or dependencies have been chosen yet.
- **Explicit non-goals** are listed in spec §14. Do not implement workflow control flow, schedulers/triggers that start work, inbound webhooks, inferred relationships, multi-user, or silent truncation.

### Spec invariants worth memorizing

These four are schema-shaped — getting them wrong early permanently degrades historical records (spec §15):

1. Run history records the **full assembled content and configuration**, not just versions.
2. **Every context edge records its author** (human or session).
3. Version retention follows the **compaction rule** (run-referenced retained, unreferenced intermediates compacted after a window, pinned runs never).
4. **Per-run output addressing** — `output@n` is the general case; `latest` is a special case of it.

## Git rules

### Conventional Commits — required

Every commit message MUST follow [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>(<optional scope>)<optional !>: <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer(s)>
```

- **Allowed types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`, `revert`.
- **Description:** imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period, ≤ 72 chars on the subject line.
- **Scope:** optional, lowercase, a short area name (e.g. `canvas`, `graph`, `sessions`, `workspaces`, `integrations`, `docs`).
- **Breaking changes:** `!` after the type/scope AND a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- Body explains *why*, not *what* the diff already shows.

Examples:

```
feat(canvas): refuse illegal edges mid-drag
fix(sessions): distinguish out-of-budget from failure
docs: add product spec north star v1
refactor(graph)!: address outputs as output@n

BREAKING CHANGE: `output` references no longer resolve implicitly to latest.
```

### History rules — fast-forward only

- **`main` accepts fast-forward merges only. No merge commits, ever.**
- A branch must land on `main` as either a **fast-forward** or a **squash** (a single Conventional Commit).
- Rebase onto `main` to integrate upstream work — never merge `main` into a branch.
- Recommended local config (already set in this clone; set it in yours):
  ```sh
  git config merge.ff only
  git config pull.rebase true
  ```
- Force-push only your own topic branches, and prefer `--force-with-lease`.

### Branch naming

`<type>/<short-slug>`, optionally prefixed with a ticket id:

```
feat/context-edge-authors
fix/session-budget-outcome
docs/contributing-guide
feat/OXY-2982-path-claims
```

Types match the Conventional Commit types.

### Worktrees

Worktrees live in the **parent directory** of this repo and are named `<repo-dir>-<branch>`, where `<repo-dir>` is this directory's name (`plotroom`) and `<branch>` has `/` replaced by `-`.

```sh
# branch feat/path-claims  ->  ../plotroom-feat-path-claims
git worktree add ../plotroom-feat-path-claims -b feat/path-claims
```

Layout:

```
andyhite/
  plotroom/                      # primary checkout (main)
  plotroom-feat-path-claims/     # worktree for feat/path-claims
  plotroom-fix-drift-flags/      # worktree for fix/drift-flags
```

Rules:

- Never create a worktree inside the repo directory.
- One worktree per branch; remove it when the branch lands: `git worktree remove ../plotroom-<branch>` then `git worktree prune`.
- The primary checkout stays on `main` and is never removed.

## Agent working agreement

- Work on a topic branch (or its worktree), never directly on `main`.
- Keep commits small and single-purpose; one logical change per commit.
- Do not commit generated artifacts, secrets, or local machine paths.
- Update `docs/` in the same commit as behavior changes that contradict it.
- Do not amend or rewrite commits that already exist on `main`.
- When a decision is not covered by the spec or this file, ask rather than inventing a convention — then record the answer here.

## Repository layout

```
docs/product-spec.md   Product specification (north star, behavior only)
AGENTS.md              This file — canonical conventions
CONTRIBUTING.md        How to contribute (workflow detail)
```

## Open decisions (not yet made)

Record answers here as they are decided; do not assume.

- Language, runtime, and package manager
- Application shell (desktop packaging) and rendering approach
- Persistence layer for graph, sessions, and run history
- Test framework and CI provider
- Commit-message and branch-name linting/enforcement tooling
- Versioning and release process
