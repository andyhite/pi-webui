# Epic loop — orchestrate, verify, integrate

An epic is delivered by running the `dev-loop` on each subtask — but never by
you directly. You are the **conductor**: you sequence, dispatch, watch,
integrate, and verify. You do not edit product code, create task worktrees, or
open task PRs; `issue-worker` subagents do that. Related skills: `tracker`
(statuses, sub-issue queries, derived epic status), `stacked-prs` (chained
subtasks), `grooming` (breakdown), `bug-triage` (integration findings),
`verification`, `worktree`.

## 1. Preflight

- The issue is labeled `epic`. A task or bug goes to the `dev-loop` instead.
- It has subtasks (tracker skill: sub-issue query). **No breakdown, no
  dispatch** — run the breakdown procedure from the `grooming` skill first
  (with the operator in the loop), then come back.
- Subtasks you intend to dispatch are at `To Do`. A subtask already
  `In Progress` belongs to another session — coordinate via the board and
  `hub`, never by dispatching a second writer.

## 2. Read everything, then fix the contracts

Read the epic, every subtask, and the spec sections they cite. Then decide —
**before any dispatch** — the cross-task contracts: shared interfaces, schema
shapes, file ownership, naming. Two workers negotiating a contract mid-flight
is how integration fails. Write the contracts as a comment on the epic (so
they survive you) and into every worker brief that touches them.

If reading reveals the breakdown is wrong — tasks too big, a missing seam, a
dependency nobody recorded — fix the breakdown first (grooming skill), don't
dispatch around it.

## 3. Partition into tracks

Build the dependency graph over subtasks, then partition it into **tracks**:

- A **chain** — subtasks where each depends on the previous one — is one
  track, delivered by **one** worker as **stacked PRs** (`stacked-prs`
  skill): one worktree, one layer per subtask, review never blocking the next
  layer. Serial work goes to one worker on purpose — it accumulates the
  chain's context instead of re-learning it per subtask.
- An independent subtask is a single-subtask track: plain dev loop, PR off
  `main`.
- A cross-track dependency (track B needs track A's layer on `main`) stays
  merge-gated: B dispatches only after that layer lands. If such edges are
  everywhere, the partition is wrong — refold the chains.

Run tracks in parallel, at most **3 workers** concurrently. `todo init`: one
omp todo per subtask grouped by track, an integration todo per landing, and a
closeout phase.

## 4. Dispatch and monitor

One `task` batch per ready set of tracks, `agent: issue-worker`, one item per
track. Each brief is self-contained (workers start blank): the issue
number(s) — for a chained track, the ordered list with the instruction to
deliver it as a stack per `skill://stacked-prs` — the epic number, the
contracts from step 2, and anything a sibling's landed work changed.

While tracks run:

- Monitor with `hub` (`jobs`, `wait`); answer worker questions promptly — an
  unanswered contract question stalls a whole track.
- Keep the epic's derived status current (tracker skill) as subtasks move.
- **Surface the merge queue to the operator**: whenever layers or PRs go to
  `Review`, tell the operator what is ready and in what order — for a stack,
  that merging layer K takes everything below it, and merging the top takes
  the whole track. The operator merges; nobody else. A comment from the
  operator on any PR is a change request the owning worker must pick up.
- A stuck worker gets steered via `hub send`; a dead one gets its issues
  reset (blocker comment, status back to `To Do`) and its track redispatched
  or split.
- Two plain-PR tracks colliding on the same files: tell the later one to
  rebase after the first lands, or serialize them.

A worker's "completed" is a claim. Verify it: PRs merged, issues `Done`,
worktree gone.

## 5. Integrate as work lands

Each track's top-of-stack rung-3 verification already proves the track's
layers work **together**. What it cannot prove is tracks working with _each
other_ — that is yours. After each meaningful landing on `main` (a track
completing, or a batch of merges):

```sh
PRIMARY=$(git worktree list --porcelain | head -1 | sed 's/^worktree //')
git -C "$PRIMARY" fetch origin main
git -C "$PRIMARY" worktree add "$PRIMARY/../plotroom-<epic>-integration" --detach origin/main
```

(Reuse it across landings: `git -C ../plotroom-<epic>-integration fetch
origin && git -C ../plotroom-<epic>-integration checkout --detach
origin/main`.)

In it: `pnpm install`, `pnpm verify`, the e2e gate, and — most importantly —
**exercise the epic's behavior across the seams** that just joined, per rung
3 of the `verification` skill.

Findings are never fixed by you in the integration worktree. File each one: a
defect in landed work is a bug (`bug-triage` skill, usually `sev1` since it
blocks the epic); a missing seam is a new subtask (grooming breakdown
addendum, linked to the epic). Dispatch fixes as their own track.

## 6. Closeout

When every subtask is `Done`:

1. Final integration pass (step 5) against the epic's own acceptance criteria
   — judge the epic against what it promised, not just against green checks.
2. Summary comment on the epic: what shipped, per-subtask PRs, how the
   integrated behavior was proven, anything deferred (as linked issues, never
   as prose someone must remember).
3. Close the epic; board status `Done` (this is the one Done that isn't tied
   to a PR of its own).
4. Remove the integration worktree. The epic is not complete while it exists.
