description: Delivering a chain of dependent PlotRoom subtasks as GitHub stacked pull requests — gh stack mechanics, layer-per-issue conventions, fixing a mid-stack layer on a change request, operator merge semantics, and the fallback when the preview is unavailable. Read when an epic track has two or more chained subtasks.

# Stacked PRs — a dependency chain ships as one stack

GitHub stacked pull requests (public preview since 2026-07) turn a chain of
dependent branches into linked PRs: each layer targets the branch below it,
reviewers see one focused diff per layer, and GitHub handles the cascading
rebases and retargeting as layers land. That maps one-to-one onto an epic
**track**: a run of subtasks where each depends on the previous one — the
worker keeps building upward instead of waiting for merges.

The operator-merge protocol composes cleanly: PRs merge **bottom-up**, so the
operator merging layer K approves layers 1…K in one gesture (merging the top
approves the whole stack), and a comment on any layer is a change request for
that layer.

## Prerequisites — check, don't assume

- `gh extension list | grep gh-stack` (install: `gh extension install
github/gh-stack`).
- The feature is **preview, subject to change**: if any `gh stack` command
  fails as unavailable, fall back to the wave model — deliver the chain
  sequentially as plain PRs, each dispatched only after the previous one
  merges — and tell the operator the stack path was unavailable.

## Conventions

- One **track = one worker = one worktree = one stack**. The track worktree is
  named `plotroom-<epic>-<track-slug>`; each layer's branch keeps the normal
  issue convention `<type>/<issue>-<slug>`.
- One **layer = one subtask issue = one PR**. Every layer passes the full
  inner dev loop (TDD, verification rungs 1–2, QA gate on the layer's diff)
  before it is submitted. The layer's QA diff is `git diff
<parent-branch>...HEAD` — the layer only, not the whole stack.
- Board statuses per layer are unchanged: `In Progress` while building,
  `Review` when its PR is open and ready, `Done` when the operator merges it.

## Build the stack

```sh
# in the track worktree, on the first layer's branch (based on origin/main)
gh stack init <type>/<issue1>-<slug>       # adopts the current branch, enables rerere
# ... dev loop for layer 1: TDD, verification, QA ...
gh stack submit --auto                      # push + draft PR + stack object on GitHub
gh pr edit <pr1> --title "<conventional header>" --body "<what/why/proof> ... Closes #<issue1>"
gh pr ready <pr1>                           # now move issue 1 to Review

gh stack add <type>/<issue2>-<slug>        # next layer, branched from layer 1's tip
# ... dev loop for layer 2 ...
gh stack submit --auto                      # creates PR 2 with base = layer 1's branch
gh pr edit <pr2> --title ... --body "... Closes #<issue2>" && gh pr ready <pr2>
# ... repeat upward ...
```

- `gh stack submit --auto` is the non-interactive path: it creates missing
  PRs as **drafts** with generated titles — always follow with `gh pr edit`
  (the title becomes the squash commit subject) and `gh pr ready`.
- `gh stack view --json` is the machine-readable stack state; use it instead
  of scraping.
- Rung-3 verification (`pnpm verify`, e2e, exercising behavior) at the top of
  the stack exercises **all layers combined** — that is the track's
  pre-merge integration test. Run it before submitting each new top.

## While the stack is open

Poll like the dev loop (`gh pr view` per open layer), plus `gh stack sync`
after anything lands:

- **Operator merges layer(s)** — always bottom-up; a mid-stack merge takes
  everything below it. Move each merged layer's issue to `Done`. Then
  `gh stack sync --prune`: trunk fast-forwards, remaining layers rebase and
  retarget `main` automatically, merged local branches are deleted.
- **Operator comments on layer K** — change request for that layer only:
  issue K back to `In Progress`; fix **on layer K's branch**; then
  `gh stack rebase` (cascades the fix up through K+1…top; `--continue` after
  resolving any conflict) and `gh stack push`; re-run the layer's gates and
  the top-of-stack verification; reply on the PR; issue K back to `Review`.
- **`main` moved underneath** — `gh stack sync` (fetch, trunk fast-forward,
  cascade rebase, force-with-lease push). Non-interactive sync aborts on a
  genuinely diverged stack instead of guessing — resolve divergence
  deliberately (`gh stack unstack` + `gh stack init` to rebuild tracking).
- **Never `gh stack merge`** — merging is the operator's gesture, on every
  layer, always.

## Restructuring

Adding a forgotten seam mid-track: `gh stack add` only stacks on top. To
insert or reorder layers use `gh stack modify` (interactive) — or, from
automation, `gh stack unstack --local` + `gh stack init <branches in order>`

- `gh stack submit`. Never restructure layers whose PRs the operator has
  already merged or queued.

## When the track is done

All layers merged: `gh stack sync --prune` (deletes merged local branches),
confirm every subtask issue is `Done`, remove the track worktree (`worktree`
skill). The stack object dissolves with its last merge; nothing to clean up
on GitHub.
