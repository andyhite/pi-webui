# Grooming — where ideas become work, or stop being carried

Grooming is a **decision pass with the operator in the loop**: the agent
researches and recommends, the operator decides, the agent applies. Never
silently accept or reject an idea on the operator's behalf. Tracker mechanics
(labels, statuses, sub-issues) live in the `tracker` skill.

## The sizing rule

**A task without an epic must be tiny**: one small PR, roughly a day or less,
independently testable. Anything larger — multiple PRs, multiple seams,
"and"-shaped scope — is an epic and gets a breakdown before any work starts.
When sizing is arguable, it's an epic; a too-small epic costs a little
ceremony, a too-big task costs an unreviewable PR.

## Grooming ideas

Work oldest-first through `gh issue list --label idea --state open`.

Per idea:

1. **Research** enough to recommend: what it touches, what the spec says
   (`docs/product-spec.md` — a proposal that violates a governing principle is
   an amendment, not a feature), what exists already, rough size. A `scout`
   dispatch is fine for the code side.
2. **Recommend** one of: _accept as task_, _accept as epic_, _reject_,
   _defer_ — with a two-or-three-sentence rationale.
3. **Ask the operator.** Batch the whole grooming session's decisions into as
   few `ask` rounds as possible.
4. **Apply**:

### Accept as task

Rewrite the body from a note into a spec, relabel `idea → task`, status
`To Do`:

```markdown
## Problem

What is wrong or missing, and why it matters.

## Proposal

The intended change, concretely. Spec references (§) where they bind.

## Acceptance criteria

- Observable outcomes, each one checkable. These are what QA judges against.

## Out of scope

What this deliberately does not do.
```

### Accept as epic

Same rewrite shape (Goal / Shape of the solution / Constraints and contracts /
Acceptance criteria), relabel `idea → epic`, status stays `Backlog`. Then
break it down — now, or as a scheduled later grooming — because **an epic
without subtasks is not actionable**.

### Reject

Close as not planned with the rationale as a comment; board status `Rejected`
(tracker skill). Rejection is a recorded decision, not a deletion — it must be
findable and re-arguable later.

### Defer

Leave it an idea, comment what information would unblock the decision.

## Breaking down an epic

The quality bar per subtask: independently deliverable as **one PR**, testable
on its own, with a clear seam to its siblings. Order by dependency. Name the
cross-task contracts (interfaces, schemas, ownership) in the epic body — the
epic orchestrator dispatches from them.

Mechanics per subtask (tracker skill): create with label `task`, body in the
task shape above, link as a sub-issue of the epic, add to the board at
`To Do`. When the breakdown lands, the epic's derived status becomes `To Do`.

Follow-on discoveries mid-epic (a missing seam found during integration) enter
the same way: a new subtask, linked, `To Do` — never prose in a comment
someone must remember.

## Grooming bugs

- **Untriaged** (plain `bug` label): triage per the `bug-triage` skill.
- **Backlog bugs** (`bug:sev2`/`bug:sev3`): for each, either promote to
  `To Do` (operator decision — capacity and priority), leave with a note, or —
  if evidence says it's moot — close as not planned with the rationale,
  status `Rejected`.

## Sweeping the board

While grooming, flag anything that smells stale and raise it with the
operator:

- `In Progress` with no matching branch/worktree activity — the session died
  without moving state; reset to `To Do` with a comment.
- `Review` with a closed or merged PR — finish the transition it missed.
- Epics whose derived status disagrees with the board — recompute (tracker
  skill) and fix.
