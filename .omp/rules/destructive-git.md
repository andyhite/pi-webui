That command destroys uncommitted or unmerged state with no undo:

- Run `git status` and read it first. In this workflow, dirty state in your
  worktree may not be yours alone — QA's e2e additions and subagent slices
  land as uncommitted changes until you commit them.
- Prefer recoverable moves: `git stash push` over `reset --hard`/`restore .`,
  `git branch -d` (refuses unmerged) over `-D`.
- `git clean -fd` deletes untracked files — new test files and fixtures that
  were never staged are exactly what it eats.
- If the point is "get back to a known state", say which state and why in
  your next commit or report — a wipe that can't be explained shouldn't run.
