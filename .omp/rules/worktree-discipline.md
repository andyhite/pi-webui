description: Worktree discipline — claim before create, one writer, remove only your own after Done
condition: 'git\s+worktree\s+(add|remove)|rm\s+-\w*r\w*\s[^\n]*plotroom-'
scope: tool
interruptMode: tool-only

Worktree operation detected — check the discipline before it runs:

- **Adding:** the issue must be claimed first (board status `In Progress`,
  before any edit), no `<issue>-` branch may already exist, the name follows
  `plotroom-<issue>-<slug>` beside the primary checkout, and the branch
  follows `<type>/<issue>-<slug>`. See `skill://worktree`.
- **Removing:** only a worktree **you** created, and only after its PR merged
  and the issue is `Done`. A worktree you did not create is another session's
  in-flight work — its dirty state is not yours to clean. `git worktree
remove` refusing a dirty tree is information, not an obstacle: look before
  `--force`.
