description: File and triage a bug (severity label, board routing)
---

Triage a bug report. The report, as given:

$ARGUMENTS

Read `skill://bug-triage` and `skill://tracker`, then run the triage procedure
end to end: search for duplicates (open and closed) first; then either comment
the new evidence on the existing issue or file a new one with the severity
rubric applied — `bug:sevN` label, added to the board, routed (`sev0`/`sev1`
→ To Do, `sev2`/`sev3` → Backlog).

If the report above is an issue number rather than a description, triage that
existing issue instead: reproduce, apply the rubric, swap `bug` for
`bug:sevN`, route it. If it is empty, sweep every open issue labeled plain
`bug` the same way.

Reply with: the issue URL, the severity and one-line justification, where it
was routed, and any duplicate/regression linkage found. A `sev0` gets said
loudly, first.
