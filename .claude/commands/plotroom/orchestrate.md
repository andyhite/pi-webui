description: Deliver an epic by orchestrating issue-worker subagents
---

Deliver epic #$1 by orchestration.

Read `skill://epic-loop`, `skill://tracker`, and `skill://stacked-prs`, then
run the epic loop exactly as written: preflight (it must be a broken-down
epic — if the breakdown is missing, run it per `skill://grooming` with my
sign-off first), fix the cross-task contracts before any dispatch, partition
the subtasks into dependency tracks, dispatch `issue-worker` subagents (one
per track, chained tracks as stacked PRs, at most 3 concurrent), keep the
epic's derived board status current, run integration verification as work
lands in an integration worktree, file integration findings as tracked
issues, and close out with the final verification and summary.

You conduct; you never edit product code, open task PRs, or merge anything.
**I merge** — surface what is ready and in what order (for a stack, note that
merging a layer takes everything below it), and my comments on any PR are
change requests for the owning worker. Verify workers' claims against the
board and `main`, not their say-so.

Report at the end: track → subtask → PR → status table, how the integrated
behavior was proven, anything deferred (as linked issues), integration
worktree removed.
